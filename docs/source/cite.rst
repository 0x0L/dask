Citations
=========

Dask is developed by many people from many institutions.  Some of these
developers are academics who depend on academic citations to justify their
efforts.  Unfortunately, no single citation can do all of these developers (and
the developers to come) sufficient justice.  Instead, we choose to use a single
blanket citation for all developers past and present.

To cite Dask in publications, please use the following::

   Dask Development Team (2016). Dask: Library for dynamic task scheduling
   URL http://dask.pydata.org

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users follows::

   @Manual{,
     title = {Dask: Library for dynamic task scheduling},
     author = {{Dask Development Team}},
     year = {2016},
     url = {http://dask.pydata.org},
   }
